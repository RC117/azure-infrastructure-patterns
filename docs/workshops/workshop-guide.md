### **Pre-work** (Individual, 15 minutes)

```text
Think about the last 6 months:
1. What infrastructure issue cost us the most time?
2. What prevents us from deploying more frequently?
3. What keeps you up at night about our infrastructure?
4. What do other teams complain about regarding our infrastructure?
```

### **Workshop Agenda**

## üéØ Workshop Success Tips

### **For Facilitators**

- **Time management**: Use visible countdown timers
- **Participation**: Ensure everyone speaks in each round
- **Conflict resolution**: Focus debates on technical merit, not personalities
- **Energy management**: Take 10-minute breaks every hour

### **For Participants**

- **Come prepared**: Do the pre-work seriously
- **Challenge ideas**: Ask "what if this doesn't work?"
- **Stay focused**: Avoid rabbit holes and scope creep
- **Document everything**: Decisions lose value if forgotten

### **For Remote Teams**

- **Tools**: Miro/Mural for visual collaboration
- **Breakouts**: Use smaller groups to increase participation
- **Engagement**: More frequent check-ins and breaks
