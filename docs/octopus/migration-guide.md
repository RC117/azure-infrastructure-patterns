# Octopus Deploy Integration Migration Guide

## Current State Analysis

Before modernizing, document your current Octopus setup:

### 1. Project Structure
- How many Octopus projects do you have?
- Which handle infrastructure vs applications?
- What's the deployment process for each?

### 2. Environment Strategy
- How are environments configured?
- What variables differ between environments?
- How do approvals work?

### 3. GitLab Integration
- How does GitLab trigger Octopus deployments?
- What artifacts/packages are created?
- Where are packages stored?

## Blue-Green with Octopus

### Option A: Octopus-Orchestrated Blue-Green
- Octopus manages the blue-green switching
- Deployment steps handle traffic routing
- Leverages Octopus's built-in capabilities

### Option B: Infrastructure-Level Blue-Green
- Terraform creates blue-green infrastructure
- Octopus deploys to the target environment
- Application Gateway handles traffic switching

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Infrastructure creates blue-green capability
- Octopus uses deployment targets for blue/green
- Best of both worlds

## Recommended Migration Path

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Modernization
1. Update Terraform to support blue-green VMSS
2. Keep existing Octopus application deployment
3. Test in dev environment

### Phase 2: Octopus Integration
1. Update Octopus projects for blue-green targets
2. Create blue-green deployment processes
3. Implement health checks and validation

### Phase 3: Full Automation
1. Automate traffic switching
2. Implement rollback procedures
3. Add comprehensive monitoring

## Key Considerations

### Variables Management
- Environment-specific VMSS names
- Blue/green target identification
- Health check endpoints

### Deployment Targets
- Dynamic target discovery
- Blue/green target roles
- Health monitoring integration

### Rollback Strategy
- Octopus-native rollback vs infrastructure rollback
- Health check failure handling
- Automatic vs manual rollback triggers
