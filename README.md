# Azure Infrastructure Patterns - Enterprise DORA Implementation

> **Elite DevOps Infrastructure following DORA best practices for Azure VMSS, PostgreSQL, and Storage**

## 🎯 Project Context for GitHub Copilot

**Current State**: Terraform-managed Azure infrastructure with GitLab pipelines (dev → prod)  
**Target State**: Blue-green deployments with immutable infrastructure and elite DORA metrics  
**Constraints**: Cannot use AKS/Kubernetes - must use VMSS, Azure Storage, PostgreSQL  
**Infrastructure**: VMSS + Application Gateway + PostgreSQL + Storage + Key Vault + Monitoring

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and logged in
- Terraform >= 1.6.0
- GitLab CI/CD access
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone and Discover Current Infrastructure

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/azure-infrastructure-patterns.git
cd azure-infrastructure-patterns

# Login to Azure and set subscription
az login
az account set --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Discover existing infrastructure (SAFE - read-only commands)
./scripts/setup/discover-current-setup.sh

# Review discovery results
cat discovery-output/SUMMARY.md
ls discovery-output/
```

#### 2. Use GitHub Copilot for Analysis

Open VS Code with both your existing Terraform files AND this repository, then use these prompts:

```text
@workspace Analyze my existing Azure infrastructure and explain the current architecture

Help me understand how to implement blue-green deployments with my current VMSS setup

Based on my discovery-output files, customize terraform.tfvars.example with my actual values

Create a migration plan from my current infrastructure to these modern patterns

Explain the security improvements these templates provide over my current setup
```

#### 3. Customize Configuration

```bash
# Find all customization points
grep -r "TODO:" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Start with development environment
cp terraform/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars

# Use GitHub Copilot to help fill in your actual values
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Target Blue-Green Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Production
        AG[Application Gateway]

        subgraph Blue["Blue (Live)"]
            VMSSB[VMSS - Blue]
        end

        subgraph Green["Green (Standby)"]
            VMSSG[VMSS - Green]
        end

        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        SA[(Storage)]
        KV[(Key Vault)]
    end

    AG --> VMSSB
    AG -. standby .-> VMSSG

    VMSSB --- DB
    VMSSG --- DB
    VMSSB --- SA
    VMSSG --- SA
    KV --- VMSSB
    KV --- VMSSG
```

### Key Components

- **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)** - Auto-scaling compute with blue-green capability
- **Application Gateway** - Load balancer with backend pool switching
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** - Managed database service
- **Azure Storage** - Blob, file, and queue storage
- **Key Vault** - Secrets and certificate management
- **Log Analytics** - Centralized logging and monitoring

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

### Security Design Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Encryption Everywhere**: At rest and in transit

### Compliance Features

- ✅ CIS benchmark compliance
- ✅ Network segmentation with NSGs
- ✅ Private endpoints for PaaS services
- ✅ Azure Key Vault integration
- ✅ Automated security scanning in CI/CD

## 📊 DORA Metrics Implementation

| Metric                    | Implementation                | Target           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Deployment Frequency**  | Blue-green via GitLab CI/CD   | Multiple per day |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Immutable images + automation | < 1 hour         |
| **Change Failure Rate**   | Staging validation + rollback | < 5%             |
| **Mean Time to Recovery** | Instant traffic switching     | < 10 minutes     |
