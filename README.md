# Azure Infrastructure Patterns with Octopus Deploy

Enterprise-grade Azure infrastructure templates with DevOps best practices, designed for **autonomous use with GitHub Copilot**.

## 🚀 Autonomous Workflow (Recommended)

This repository is designed to work **completely autonomously** with GitHub Copilot at work - no need to sync files between personal and work computers.

### Quick Start
1. **Clone this repository at work**
2. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code**
3. **Share the [COPILOT-CONTEXT.md](COPILOT-CONTEXT.md) content** with Copilot
4. **Use prompts from [COPILOT-PROMPTS.md](COPILOT-PROMPTS.md)** to analyze your infrastructure

### Your Infrastructure Stack
```
GitLab (Source + CI) → Octopus Deploy (Deployment Orchestration) → Azure (VMSSs + PostgreSQL + Storage)
```

## 🎯 Project Goals

Transform your infrastructure to achieve **DORA Elite Performance**:
- **Deployment Frequency**: Multiple deployments per day
- **Lead Time**: Minutes instead of hours/days  
- **Change Failure Rate**: <5%
- **Recovery Time**: <2 minutes via traffic switching

## 🔄 Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

### Current State
```
Single VMSS per environment → Manual deployments → Downtime during updates
```

### Target State  
```
Blue VMSS (Live) ←→ Application Gateway ←→ Green VMSS (New Version)
Zero downtime • Instant rollback • Comprehensive validation
```

## 🤖 Using GitHub Copilot

### Step 1: Set Context
Copy and paste the entire [COPILOT-CONTEXT.md](COPILOT-CONTEXT.md) file into GitHub Copilot Chat.

### Step 2: Start Analysis
```
I've provided complete context about my Azure infrastructure modernization project. First, analyze my existing Terraform files and current VMSS configuration. What's the current architecture and what are the biggest modernization opportunities?
```

### Step 3: Iterate and Implement
Use the prompts in [COPILOT-PROMPTS.md](COPILOT-PROMPTS.md) to guide your modernization journey.

## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Dev Environment (Week 1)
- Analyze current dev infrastructure
- Design blue-green VMSS architecture
- Test deployment and rollback procedures

### Phase 2: Pipeline Integration (Week 2)
- Update GitLab CI/CD for blue-green support
- Modify Octopus Deploy processes
- Implement automated health checks

### Phase 3: Staging & Production (Weeks 3-4)
- Apply learnings to staging environment
- Gradual production migration
- Team training and documentation

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- **CIS Benchmarks** automated in VM image building
- **Defense in Depth** with network segmentation
- **Zero Trust** with private endpoints and managed identities
- **Automated Scanning** integrated in CI/CD pipeline

## 🔍 Key Features

### Immutable Infrastructure
- **Packer-built VM images** with security hardening
- **Monthly patching cycles** with automated testing
- **Versioned deployments** with easy rollback

### Zero-Downtime Deployments
- **Blue-green VMSS pairs** with Application Gateway switching
- **Health check validation** before traffic migration
- **Instant rollback** via traffic redirection

### Enterprise Integration
- **Octopus Deploy compatibility** with existing workflows
- **GitLab CI/CD integration** with security gates
- **Azure Key Vault** for secrets management

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After implementation, you should achieve:
- ✅ **Zero-downtime deployments** through blue-green switching
- ✅ **Sub-2-minute rollbacks** via traffic redirection
- ✅ **Multiple deployments per day** with confidence
- ✅ **Automated security compliance** with CIS benchmarks
- ✅ **Comprehensive monitoring** with golden signals
